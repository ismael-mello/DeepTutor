DeepTutor has two QQ-family channels:

| Channel | Use when | Config key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **QQ** | You have an official Tencent QQ bot account and app credentials. | `qq` |
| **QQ (NapCat)** | You want to connect a personal QQ account through NapCat / OneBot v11. | `napcat` |

## Official QQ bot (`qq`)

Install the Partners extra, then create a bot in the [QQ Bot Development Platform](https://bot.q.qq.com/). Enable the message types you need, such as C2C/direct and group messages.

Configuration fields:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Start the channel with the partner. |
| `app_id` | App ID from Tencent's bot platform. |
| `secret` | Bot secret. |
| `allow_from` | Allowed QQ user ids / openids. Empty denies access; use explicit ids for production. |
| `msg_format` | `plain` or `markdown`. Start with `plain` if clients render Markdown inconsistently. |

Start with:

```bash
deeptutor partner start <partner-id>
```

## Personal QQ through NapCat (`napcat`)

NapCat exposes a personal QQ account through a OneBot v11 WebSocket endpoint. Run NapCat separately, then point DeepTutor at its WebSocket URL.

Configuration fields:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Start the channel with the partner. |
| `ws_url` | NapCat WebSocket endpoint, default `ws://127.0.0.1:3001`. |
| `access_token` | Optional OneBot access token. |
| `allow_from` | Allowed user ids. Use `*` only for local testing. |
| `group_policy` | `mention`, `open`, or a probability between `0` and `1`. Mentions/replies always respond. |
| `group_policy_overrides` | Per-group policy map, keyed by group id. |
| `welcome_new_members` | Whether to welcome new group members. |
| `max_image_bytes` | Hard cap for inbound image downloads. |

## Choosing between them

Use `qq` for stable official bot deployments and group compliance. Use `napcat` for a personal-account workflow when you control the local NapCat runtime and understand the risk of personal-account automation.

## Production notes

- Prefer `qq` for official deployments where approval, compliance, and stable app credentials matter.
- Prefer `napcat` only when you intentionally run and maintain a local personal-account bridge.
- For group chats, start with mention-only behavior (`group_policy: mention`) and loosen it only after measuring noise.
- Keep `max_image_bytes` conservative when the Partner runs on a small server.

## Troubleshooting

- **Official QQ auth failed** — verify `app_id`, `secret`, and enabled message intents in Tencent's platform.
- **NapCat connects but no messages** — check `ws_url`, `access_token`, and whether NapCat is emitting OneBot v11 message events.
- **Group is too noisy** — set `group_policy` to `mention` or a low probability such as `0.1`.
