description: Connect a Partner to a Mochat customer-support panel over Socket.IO with automatic HTTP polling fallback.
---

<img src="/channel-icons/mochat.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40" />

The `mochat` channel connects a Partner to Mochat, a customer-support style chat panel. It talks to your Mochat instance over **Socket.IO** and falls back to **HTTP polling** automatically when the socket cannot connect, so the channel keeps working behind picky proxies. Useful when you want a Partner embedded in a support widget rather than a personal messenger.

## Install requirements

Mochat support is included with the Partners extra, which carries `python-socketio` and `msgpack`. Without `python-socketio` the channel still works in polling mode.

```bash
pip install -e ".[partners]"
# or, from an installed release when partners extras are available:
pip install "deeptutor[partners]"
```

## Get a Claw Token

In your Mochat admin panel, create a bot account and copy its **Claw Token**. The channel refuses to start without it (`Mochat claw_token not configured` in the log).

## Configure the channel card

Open **Partners -> your partner -> Channels -> Mochat**.

| Field | What to enter |
| --- | --- |
| **Send Progress** | Keep on while testing. It sends narration updates during long turns. |
| **Send Tool Hints** | Keep on for debugging; turn off if you do not want users to see one-line tool calls. |
| **Enabled** | Turn on only when you are ready to start the channel. |
| **Base Url** | Your Mochat instance. Default: `https://mochat.io`. |
| **Socket Url** | Optional separate Socket.IO endpoint. Blank means use **Base Url**. |
| **Socket Path** | Socket.IO mount path. Default: `/socket.io`. |
| **Socket Disable Msgpack** | Off by default (msgpack is used when available). Turn on to force JSON if your server has no msgpack parser. |
| **Socket Reconnect Delay Ms** | Initial reconnect delay. Default `1000`. |
| **Socket Max Reconnect Delay Ms** | Reconnect backoff cap. Default `10000`. |
| **Socket Connect Timeout Ms** | Connection timeout. Default `10000`. |
| **Refresh Interval Ms** | How often the channel refreshes its session/panel directory. Default `30000`. |
| **Watch Timeout Ms** | Long-poll timeout in HTTP fallback mode. Default `25000`. |
| **Claw Token** | Required. The bot token from your Mochat admin panel. |
| **Sessions** | Session ids to watch, one per line. `*` auto-discovers and subscribes new sessions. |
| **Panels** | Panel ids to watch, one per line. `*` auto-discovers panels. Leave both lists empty and the channel watches nothing. |
| **Allow From** | One value per line. Use `*` for an open test channel, or specific Mochat user ids. Empty denies access. |

### Advanced fields

These tune retries and group behavior; the defaults are fine for a first deployment.

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Watch Limit** | Max events fetched per poll. Default `100`. |
| **Retry Delay Ms** | Delay between failed HTTP retries. Default `500`. |
| **Max Retry Attempts** | `0` means retry forever (also applies to socket reconnects). |
| **Agent User Id** | The bot's own Mochat user id. Used to ignore the bot's own messages and to detect @-mentions. |
| **Mention** | `require_in_groups` — require an @-mention before answering in group sessions. |
| **Groups** | Per-group overrides, keyed by group id: `{"<group-id>": {"require_mention": true}}`. |
| **Reply Delay Mode** | `non-mention` (default) buffers panel messages that do not mention the bot; any other value disables buffering. |
| **Reply Delay Ms** | Buffer window. Default `120000` (2 minutes). |

With the default reply-delay mode, rapid-fire panel messages are batched into one Partner turn: each new message restarts the timer, and a direct @-mention flushes the buffer immediately.

## After you save

1. Save the card with **Enabled** on and **Claw Token** filled.
2. Start (or restart) the partner from the UI or CLI.
3. Check the log: a socket connection, or a polling-fallback warning — both are workable.
4. Send a short message in a watched session or panel.
5. Once you see real user ids in the logs, replace `*` in **Allow From** with explicit values.

```bash
deeptutor partner start <partner-id>
```

## Verify it is healthy

A healthy Mochat channel has three signs:

- the log shows a Socket.IO connection (or an explicit polling fallback, not an auth error);
- `data/partners/<partner-id>/runtime/mochat/session_cursors.json` is being written — this is the watch position;
- a short message from an allowed user produces a Partner reply.

For Docker, persist `data/partners/` so cursors survive restarts.

## Troubleshooting

### Socket.IO keeps reconnecting or never connects

Check **Socket Url** / **Socket Path** against your Mochat deployment. If the server cannot speak msgpack, turn on **Socket Disable Msgpack**. You can also just let it run: the channel falls back to HTTP polling on its own, trading a little latency for robustness.

### Channel exits immediately

The log says `Mochat claw_token not configured`. Fill **Claw Token** and restart the partner.

### Subscriptions fail / token stopped working

Log lines like `Mochat subscribePanels failed` usually mean the Claw Token is invalid, expired, or the bot was not approved in the Mochat admin panel. Regenerate the token, update the card, and restart.

### Connected, but no messages come in

Check that **Sessions** or **Panels** actually lists something (or `*`), and that the sender passes **Allow From**. In group sessions, also check whether a mention requirement is configured.
