description: Configure the email channel for a Partner using IMAP polling for inbound mail and SMTP replies.

<img src="/channel-icons/email.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40" />

The `email` channel turns a Partner into an asynchronous mailbox correspondent: it polls an IMAP inbox for unread mail and answers through SMTP. There is no realtime connection — turnaround is one poll cycle — which makes it a natural fit for help-desk style support and for users who simply prefer email over chat apps.

## Install requirements

Nothing extra. The email channel is built entirely on Python's standard library (`imaplib` + `smtplib`), so every DeepTutor install can run it — no additional pip packages, no extras.

## Prepare a mail account

The Partner needs its own mailbox with IMAP and SMTP access. Do not reuse a personal inbox: the channel reads and replies to everything unread.

**Gmail**

1. Enable 2-Step Verification on the account.
2. Create an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) — a 16-character password used in place of the account password. With 2FA on, regular passwords are rejected for IMAP/SMTP.
3. Make sure IMAP is on: Gmail Settings -> **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** -> Enable IMAP.
4. Hosts: `imap.gmail.com:993` (SSL) and `smtp.gmail.com:587` (STARTTLS).

**Outlook / Office 365** — with 2FA enabled, an App Password works the same way if your tenant allows them; otherwise ask your admin.

**Self-hosted** (Postfix, Maddy, ...) — use the account credentials directly and fill in your own hosts and ports.

## Configure the channel card

Open **Partners -> your partner -> Channels -> Email**.

| Field | What to enter |
| --- | --- |
| **Send Progress** | Each progress update becomes a separate email. Fine for a first test; most deployments turn it off to keep inboxes quiet. |
| **Send Tool Hints** | Same caveat — one email per hint. Turn off outside debugging. |
| **Enabled** | Turn on when you are ready to start polling. |
| **Consent Granted** | Hard privacy gate. The channel refuses to read or send any mail until this is on. Enable it only after the mailbox owner has explicitly agreed to let DeepTutor process the inbox. |
| **Imap Host** | e.g. `imap.gmail.com`. |
| **Imap Port** | Default `993` (IMAP over SSL). |
| **Imap Username** | Usually the full address, e.g. `tutor@example.com`. |
| **Imap Password** | The App Password (Gmail/Outlook with 2FA) or account password (self-hosted). Stored as a secret. |
| **Imap Mailbox** | Default `INBOX`. Some providers spell folders differently — check webmail if polling finds nothing. |
| **Imap Use Ssl** | Keep on for port 993. |
| **Smtp Host** | e.g. `smtp.gmail.com`. |
| **Smtp Port** | Default `587` (STARTTLS). Use `465` together with **Smtp Use Ssl**. |
| **Smtp Username** | Usually the same as Imap Username. |
| **Smtp Password** | Usually the same App Password. Stored as a secret. |
| **Smtp Use Tls** | STARTTLS on port 587. Keep on unless you switch to implicit SSL below. |
| **Smtp Use Ssl** | Implicit SSL, typically port 465. Enable one of the two TLS options, not both. |
| **From Address** | Optional. Blank falls back to Smtp Username, then Imap Username. |
| **Auto Reply Enabled** | When off, the Partner stops replying automatically to inbound mail (proactive sends still work). Useful as a brake while testing. |
| **Poll Interval Seconds** | Default `30`. How often the inbox is checked; values below 5 are clamped to 5. |
| **Mark Seen** | Marks processed mail as read — this is the primary duplicate protection. Leave on. |
| **Max Body Chars** | Default `12000`. Longer bodies are truncated before reaching the Partner. |
| **Subject Prefix** | Default `Re: `. Prepended to reply subjects unless the subject already starts with `Re:`. |
| **Allow From** | One email address per line, lowercase. `*` for an open test channel. Empty denies everyone. |

Each unique sender address is its own session, and replies carry `In-Reply-To` headers so they thread correctly in the sender's mail client.

## After you save

1. Click **Save**, then turn on both **Enabled** and **Consent Granted** and save again.
2. Start the partner — from the UI, or `deeptutor partner start <partner-id>`. If it is already running, restart it so the channel picks up the new config.
3. Send a test email from an address listed in **Allow From** and wait up to one poll interval for the reply.
4. Once replies flow, replace `*` in **Allow From** with the real addresses you want to serve.

## Verify it is healthy

A healthy email channel has three signs:

- the log shows `Starting Email channel (IMAP polling mode)...` with no `missing:` or consent warnings;
- a test mail from an allowed sender gets a reply within roughly one poll interval;
- processed messages show up as read in the mailbox (when **Mark Seen** is on).

## Troubleshooting

### The channel starts and then does nothing

Check the log. `consent_granted is false` means the consent gate is off — that is deliberate friction, flip **Consent Granted** consciously. `Email channel not configured, missing: ...` lists exactly which of the six required fields (IMAP/SMTP host, username, password) are empty.

### IMAP authentication failed

On Gmail and Outlook with 2FA, the account password never works for IMAP/SMTP — you need an App Password. Also confirm IMAP is enabled in the provider's settings; Gmail ships with it off.

### Duplicate replies to the same email

**Mark Seen** is the primary dedup: if it is off, every poll re-reads the same unread mail. Also make sure only one running partner polls this mailbox — two instances will race each other.

### Reply storms with auto-responders

If the Partner mails an address that auto-replies (vacation responders, other bots), the two can loop once per poll interval. Keep **Allow From** tight so strangers' auto-replies are dropped at the gate, and use **Auto Reply Enabled** off as an emergency brake.

### Replies land in spam

Set a proper **From Address**, and for self-hosted domains add SPF/DKIM/DMARC records or relay outbound mail through a trusted SMTP service.
