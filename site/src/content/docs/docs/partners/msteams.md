description: Configure the Microsoft Teams channel for a Partner — Azure Bot registration, public messaging endpoint, and inbound JWT validation.

<img src="/channel-icons/msteams.svg" alt="" width="40" height="40" />

The `msteams` channel connects a Partner to Microsoft Teams through the **Bot Framework**. Unlike every other DeepTutor channel, it does not dial out: it runs a small **built-in HTTP server** (default `0.0.0.0:3978`, path `/api/messages`) and Microsoft's servers POST each message to it. That means you need a **publicly reachable HTTPS endpoint** — in production, put a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a Cloudflare Tunnel) in front of the port and point the Azure Bot's messaging endpoint at it. For local testing, a tunnel like `ngrok http 3978` works fine.

The current scope is DM-first: text in, text out. Group and channel messages are ignored, and attachments are not yet supported.

## Install requirements

Teams support ships with the Partners extra. Inbound requests are verified with `PyJWT[crypto]`, which is already included — nothing extra to install.

```bash
pip install -e ".[partners]"
# or, from an installed release when partners extras are available:
pip install "deeptutor[partners]"
```

## Register a bot with Azure

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open **Microsoft Entra ID -> App registrations -> New registration**. Name it, pick the supported account types (single tenant is fine), and register. Copy the **Application (client) ID** — this becomes **App Id** — and the **Directory (tenant) ID** — this becomes **Tenant Id**.
2. In the registration, open **Certificates & secrets -> New client secret**. Copy the secret **Value** immediately (it is shown only once) — this becomes **App Password**.
3. Create an **Azure Bot** resource (search for "Azure Bot" in the marketplace). Under *Microsoft App ID*, choose **Use existing app registration** and paste your App Id. Match the bot's tenancy type to the registration: a single-tenant registration needs a single-tenant bot.
4. In the bot resource, go to **Settings -> Configuration** and set the **Messaging endpoint** to your public HTTPS address ending in the channel path, e.g. `https://bots.example.com/api/messages`.
5. Go to **Settings -> Channels** and add the **Microsoft Teams** channel.
6. To start chatting, use the **Open in Teams** link on the Teams channel line. For org-wide distribution, package a Teams app manifest that references the same App Id.

## Configure the channel card

Open **Partners -> your partner -> Channels -> Microsoft Teams**.

| Field | What to enter |
| --- | --- |
| **Send Progress** | Keep on while testing. It delivers narration updates during long turns. |
| **Send Tool Hints** | Keep on for debugging; turn off if users should not see one-line tool calls. |
| **Enabled** | Turn on only when you are ready to start the channel. |
| **App Id** | The Application (client) ID of the app registration. Also used as the expected audience when validating inbound JWTs. |
| **App Password** | The client secret value. Stored as a secret and masked after save. |
| **Tenant Id** | The Directory (tenant) ID. Required for single-tenant registrations; leave blank only for multi-tenant bots. |
| **Host** | Bind address for the built-in HTTP server. Default `0.0.0.0` listens on all interfaces; use `127.0.0.1` if a local reverse proxy is the only client. |
| **Port** | Listening port. Default `3978`, the Bot Framework convention. |
| **Path** | URL path for inbound activities. Default `/api/messages`; it must match the tail of the messaging endpoint. |
| **Allow From** | One value per line. Use `*` for a first test, or Microsoft Entra object ids — the partner logs print the id of any denied sender. Empty denies everyone. |
| **Reply In Thread** | When on (default), replies attach to the triggering message instead of starting a new one. |
| **Mention Only Response** | The text sent back when a message contains nothing but the bot @mention. |
| **Validate Inbound Auth** | Keep on. Verifies the Bot Framework JWT on every request (RS256 against Microsoft's published keys, audience = App Id). Turning it off lets anyone who finds the URL talk to your partner as any user — local testing only. |
| **Ref Ttl Days** | Days an idle conversation reference is kept before pruning. Default `30`. |
| **Prune Web Chat Refs** | Drops Bot Framework Web Chat conversations from the stored references (Web Chat is not supported). |
| **Prune Non Personal Refs** | Drops group/channel conversation references; the channel is DM-only for now. |
| **Ref Touch Interval S** | Minimum seconds between timestamp refreshes on an active conversation reference. Default `300`. |
| **Trusted Service Url Hosts** | Allowlist of Bot Framework hosts the channel accepts and replies to. The default covers the public, GCC, and DoD Teams clouds — extend it only if Microsoft routes you elsewhere. |

## After you save

1. Click **Save**, then turn **Enabled** on.
2. Start the partner (or restart it / use the reload action on the Channels panel if it is already running).
3. Check that the endpoint is reachable from outside: `curl -X POST https://your-domain/api/messages -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'` should return **401** (the JWT check rejecting you) — a connection error means the proxy path is broken.
4. From an allowed account, open the bot in Teams (the **Open in Teams** link) and send a short DM.
5. Once you have confirmed the sender id in the logs, replace `*` in **Allow From** with real ids.

## Verify it is healthy

- The logs show `MSTeams webhook listening on http://0.0.0.0:3978/api/messages` at startup.
- An unauthenticated POST to the public endpoint returns 401, not a timeout — the proxy chain works and the JWT gate is up.
- A DM from an allowed account gets a reply, and `msteams_conversations.json` appears in the partner's runtime directory — conversation references are being persisted.

## Troubleshooting

### Teams reports the message could not be sent

The messaging endpoint is unreachable. Confirm the endpoint URL ends with your **Path**, the certificate is valid HTTPS, and the reverse proxy forwards to **Host**:**Port**. The `curl` probe from the checklist above isolates this in one step.

### Every inbound request is rejected with 401

Inbound JWT validation is failing. The most common cause is an **App Id** mismatch between the channel card and the bot registration — the token's audience must equal the App Id. If you recently recreated the registration, update the card. Do not work around this by disabling **Validate Inbound Auth** outside local testing.

### Replies fail with a token error

The channel could receive but cannot authenticate to send. This is the tenant trap: a **single-tenant** registration with **Tenant Id** left blank makes DeepTutor request tokens from the multi-tenant endpoint, which Microsoft rejects. Set **Tenant Id** to the Directory (tenant) ID and save.

### The bot answers DMs but ignores group chats and channels

By design: the channel is currently DM-only. Non-personal conversations are dropped on arrival (and pruned from stored references when **Prune Non Personal Refs** is on).
